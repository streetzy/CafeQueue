# CafeQueue

Frontend + Backend project for simulating a cafe chain that displays orders and their status.

http://localhost:3000 for frontend

Might need to npm install in CafeQueue, frontend, backend

cd frontend, npm run dev
cd backend, npm run start

Important note:
Frontend w/ react isn't really developed properly, mainly since I am very inexperienced w/ React

This means that there are some features which I am unsatisfied with but am unsure about how to fix:
To implement the displaying of every individual location, there's a select and a button that then gets us over to the panel of the location.

The problem here is that to show if an order is prepared, picked up... we have to click the submit button that shows us the location.

Another problem is that a location isn't shown in either the view all panel nor the select location prompt until you add an order, which I think is still a frontend issue, because I think I implemented the backend correctly, but I may be wrong.

Those are all the problems I am aware of that I want to still fix/find out how to fix.
